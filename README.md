# Bungee\_sim

A MATLAB simulation modeling the physics of bungee jumping, focusing on velocity, displacement, force, and energy over time.

## Overview

This project simulates the dynamics of a bungee jump using MATLAB. It incorporates various physical considerations, including:

* Velocity and displacement analysis
* G-force and strain calculations
* Elastic modulus derived from stress vs. strain graphs
* Cord properties: area, length, mass, and stiffness
* Time-based simulations of velocity, displacement, force, and energy

The simulation aims to provide insights into the behavior of a bungee jumper and the forces involved during the jump.

## Project Structure

* `velocity_consideration.m` - Analyzes velocity aspects of the jump.
* `gforce_strain.m` - Calculates G-force and strain during the jump.
* `elastic_modulus.m` - Derives elastic modulus from stress-strain data.
* `cord_properties.m` - Defines cord area, length, mass, and stiffness.
* `simulation.m` - Runs the complete simulation and generates plots.
